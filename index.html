    <p>“Hello, my name is Samah. I am 24 years old. I live in Jerash. 
        I studied computer science at Al-Balqa Applied University 
        I worked with the Ministry of Digital Economy in the Sanad project for 6 months. 
        I have a great passion for achieving success and achieving goals.
        I started training at Attibone Company from the month of 11 until now.
        I learned the Java language and software development, where I learned a lot of techniques.
        I am excited to continue developing myself and learning more.
        I am also interested in innovation and technological development.
        I closely follow the latest industry trends and always try to apply new technology and tools to improve my work</p>
